# ABSENTEEISM
Absenteeism dataset exploration

THE DATASET

This is the data set of an already existing study about the prediction of absenteeism at work.

Dataset: "Absenteeism_data.csv"

Raw dataset's columns: ID, Reason for Absence, Date, Transportation Expense, Distance to Work, Age, Daily Work Load Average, Body Mass Index, Education, Children, Pets, Absenteeism Time in Hours

We are trying to predict Absenteeism Time in Hours

This analysis will explore  whether a person presenting certain characteristics  is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not. 
In other words, we want to know how many working hours an employee could be away from work for, based on information  such as how far they live from their workplace, how many children and pets they have and whether they have higher education and so on.


PREPROCESSING

All the data preprocessing is executed in the Jupyter Notebook file "Absenteeism - Preprocessing.ipynb"
The resulting preprocessed dataset is: Absenteeism_preprocessed.csv
